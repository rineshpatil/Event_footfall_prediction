# MLT_PROJECT
This repository contains a Python notebook for a machine learning project that predicts event attendees based on registration forms.

# Overview
The project uses various Python libraries, including pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow, to create and evaluate machine learning models for event attendance prediction.

# Code Structure
* Importing the python Libraries: The project starts by importing the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation and model building.
* Reads a CSV file: The project reads a CSV file named "iro_dataset.csv" to load the dataset.
* Data Preprocessing: The project performs data preprocessing tasks, including identifying non-numeric columns, applying label encoding, and one-hot encoding categorical columns.
* Model Building and Evaluation: The project builds and evaluates two machine learning models: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree Classifier. It calculates accuracy, F1 score, and creates confusion matrices for model evaluation.
* Performance and Correlation Graphs: The project visualizes the performance and correlation of the models using bar plots and heatmaps.

# Usage
To run the notebook, simply open it in a Jupyter environment or Colab and execute each code cell sequentially. The notebook provides a step-by-step demonstration of the machine learning project for event attendance prediction.

## Feel free to explore, modify, and use the code for your own projects!
